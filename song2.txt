I can't get it out of me
It's breathing inside of me
It's reaching in side of you
You're feeling infected
You've been infected
It's just like a cold
A kiss on your lips
Now you're taking control
I feel like a criminal
I'm falling apart
I'm leaving for Venus
In a getaway car
No one can save us
It's no need to try
I'm looking for savers
Holding us back
